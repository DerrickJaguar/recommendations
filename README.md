# Django Recommendations Library

## Overview

A powerful Django-based recommendation library that provides sophisticated content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendations for various types of content (music, products, articles, etc.). This library leverages user behavior patterns, preferences, and item similarities to deliver personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **Multiple Recommendation Engines:**
  - Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items based on content similarity and user preferences
  - Collaborative Filtering: Makes recommendations based on user behavior patterns and similarities
  - Hybrid Recommendations: Combines both approaches for more accurate suggestions
- **Flexible Integration** with existing Django projects
- **Customizable Parameters** for fine-tuning recommendations
- **Scalable Architecture** suitable for both small and large datasets
- **Real-time Preference Updates** based on user interactions
- **Caching Support** for improved performance

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Django 3.2+
- PostgreSQL (recommended) or SQLite

### Via pip

```bash
pip install recommendations
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendations.git
cd recommendations
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

### 1. Add to INSTALLED_APPS

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'recommendations',
]
```

### 2. Configure Settings (Optional)

```python
RECOMMENDATIONS_SETTINGS = {
    'CACHE_TIMEOUT': 3600,  # Cache duration in seconds
    'MIN_SIMILARITY_SCORE': 0.3,  # Minimum similarity threshold
    'MAX_RECOMMENDATIONS': 50,  # Maximum items to recommend
    'WEIGHT_CONTENT_BASED': 0.5,  # For hybrid recommendations
    'WEIGHT_COLLABORATIVE': 0.5,
    'UPDATE_INTERVAL': 3600,  # Preference update interval
}
```

### 3. Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate recommendations
```

## Usage

# Content-Based Filtering

The content-based engine recommends items similar to what a user has liked based on item attributes (e.g., genre, tags).

# python

from recommendations.engine.content_based import ContentBasedFilteringEngine

engine = ContentBasedFilteringEngine()
recommendations = engine.recommend(user, num_recommendations=5)
Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative engine suggests items based on interactions from similar users.

```python

from recommendations.engine.collaborative_filtering import CollaborativeFilteringEngine

engine = CollaborativeFilteringEngine()
recommendations = engine.recommend(user, num_recommendations=5)

# Hybrid Recommendations
The hybrid engine combines content-based and collaborative filtering for more personalized results.

from recommendations.engine.hybrid import HybridRecommendationEngine

engine = HybridRecommendationEngine()
recommendations = engine.recommend(user, num_recommendations=5)
Updating User Preferences
To dynamically adjust user preferences based on interactions:

# python
engine.update_preferences(user)

## API Methods
recommend(user, num_recommendations=10): Generate recommendations for a specified user.
update_preferences(user): Update user preferences based on recent interactions.
get_user_preferences(user): Retrieve the current preference profile for a user.

Examples
# Using Recommendations in Views

# python

from django.shortcuts import render
from recommendations.engine.hybrid import HybridRecommendationEngine

def recommended_items_view(request):
    user = request.user
    engine = HybridRecommendationEngine()
    recommendations = engine.recommend(user, num_recommendations=10)
    return render(request, 'recommendations.html', {'recommendations': recommendations})

# Testing Recommendation Engines
In your Django test suite, you can set up and validate the recommendation engines like this:

from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from recommendations.engine.hybrid import HybridRecommendationEngine

class RecommendationTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.user = User.objects.create(username="testuser")
        # Set up tracks, interactions, etc.

    def test_recommendation_engine(self):
        engine = HybridRecommendationEngine()
        recommendations = engine.recommend(self.user, num_recommendations=5)
        self.assertGreater(len(recommendations), 0)
          # Test to ensure recommendations are returned

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
# Q1: What types of content are supported?
A1: The library is content-agnostic and can be used for any type of content (music, articles, products, etc.), as long as you provide structured data with relevant attributes.

# Q2: Can I adjust the weighting of recommendation types?
A2: Yes, the weights for content-based and collaborative filtering in hybrid mode can be set in the configuration.

# Q3: What database works best?
A3: PostgreSQL is recommended for performance on large datasets, but the library also supports SQLite for smaller applications.

# Q4: Does it support real-time recommendations?
A4: Yes, the library supports real-time updates based on user interactions.

# Q5: Is this library suitable for large-scale applications?
A5: Yes, it is designed to scale with caching and database optimizations, suitable for both small and large datasets.
